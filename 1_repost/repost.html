    <h1>A Tale Best Forgotten</h1>

    <p>

Hail! Most Holy annubis

<br>
In a house by a river that lamented as it ran,
<br>
Lived a father, and his daughter, and the dog-headed man.
<br>
A father, and his daughter, and the dog-headed man!
<br>
It’s a tale best forgotten, but before the tale began
From the house to the river limped the dog-headed man.
<br>
Blood swelled the river before the tale began.
<br>
In the garden, in the garden, while the river slowly ran,
Walked the daughter, and her lover, and the dog-headed man.
<br>
The daughter, and her lover, and the dog-headed man!
<br>
It’s a tale best forgotten, but before the tale began
His daughter, by the river that reflected as it ran,
Fed the bones of her lover to the dog-headed man.
<br>

Dog Head he was fed before the tale began.

I've decided to create a video consisting of different characters reading out my poem.
From the Social Media Apps 'Tom the Cat' and 'Chatterbox' I've manipulated characters to read out my poem.
My poem (well technically Helen's poem) is a tale that never ends and represents ideas that reflect
 'snake eats the snake'; it doesn't make sense and neither does my distorted video.
Its werid and wonderful. Enjoy </P>
