<h1>

      An exploration of taste</h1>
      <br>

April 12, 2018 <br>

 by Audrey Meski
 <br>
 <br>
My experience of the Triennial begun like any other. I started my journey on the ground floor, joining a crowd of tourists and locals alike, phones at the ready for the perfect insta pic.
However, as the crowd dissipated, I was met with a large scale print of a figure wearing all black sitting in front of a white wall, both hands on either side of a poo emoji mask. The person
is covered in smaller photos of people, with their identities obscured by emojis, all interacting with one another. One can easily get drawn into the photograph, trying to make sense of each figure and the story they tell.
I was intrigued; the poo emoji is generally not synonymous with high culture, and yet here it was within one of Australia’s most prevalent galleries. Art has long been a tool to explore the normalities of life, however there
 is still quite an exclusive and high brow quality to the works found within galleries.
Throughout history, galleries and art collections have been an authority of sorts on what is considered to be in <div class="quote">‘good taste’,</br>  featuring only the best works worthy of display. These are usually quite traditional and may be alienating
 for the general public, a feeling which is furthered by the often very sombre and serious atmosphere of the space itself.
There is an air of exclusivity; taste can function as a marker of<div class="quote"> ‘class’,</div>  if one does not share the same ideals, an <div class="quote">‘us and them’</div> mentality is enforced.[1] Cultural goods have their own economy; pop culture and emojis whilst incredibly widespread,
do not hold the same cultural capital as the opera and German poetry. However does this mean it is of any less value?
Could such works as <div class="quote">‘Emojis II’ <div> be considered to be in good taste, worthy of its place in such a prestigious location?
These digital collages are the work of Swiss born artist, Olaf Breuning. Currently residing in New York City, Breuning has explored a wide variety of media throughout his career, including video, sculpture, drawing and photography. As evident from
his works, Breuning believes art doesn’t necessarily need to be serious or always have a deep, thoughtful meaning.[2] Through his use of humour, he is able to explore the daily life of a generation growing up on social media, surrounded by technology.
When asked about the serious nature of most art, Breuning commented  <div class="quote">“[contemporary art] always tries to make more than it really is, pretends to be more, pretends to be smarter or more exclusive… It’s a small club of understanding people and outside of that
island no one gives a shit, because no one understands it.”[3] </div>
Breuning himself is more than aware of the elitism present in the art world, combating the ever serious and at times arrogant through humour and mainstream imagery.

References to pop culture are often regarded as being <div class="quote">‘low brow’, </div> with <div class="quote">‘high brow’ </div> culture being seen as intellectual and therefore superior. Between these two extremes is that of the middle brow, who strive for the elite, with both looking down upon those who fall into the low brow category.
However in recent years, there has been discussion of a new category which is a mixture of both high and low culture, known as the <div class="quote">‘no brow’.[4]
Humanity and our interests can not be so easily categorised and our art and culture should reflect this. Playful works such as<div class="quote"> ‘Emoji II’</div>  makes the high brow act of visiting a gallery accessible and approachable for the general public through its use of prominent everyday
</div>  images. Emojis don’t discriminate, everyone with access to a smart phone and social media has a general understanding of these playful icons.

<br>



In the past the art gallery was a static and often cold space, unwelcoming to those without the cultural capital to recognise and appreciate high art. However exhibitions such as the Triennial are making such spaces inviting and encouraging participation and a sense of play. Families and f
riends alike are lining up to experience a modern take on art and design, sparking a love of art in the future generation of creatives. This mixing of high and low brow as found within Breuning’s photo collages is vital for the future of art. High culture is often alienating, so it is always
reassuring when one can recognise something present within their own life experiences within the gallery space. The exhibition itself was also spread throughout the 3 levels of the building, interspersed between the permanent collection, allowing the more approachable works to act as an entry into the art world and prompt further exploration.
While it can be argued whether Breuning’s work can be considered good taste, it plays an important role in making art accessible for all ages and backgrounds.
Low brow culture is often disregarded and seen as being of less value, creating a divide between people of differing cultural and economic backgrounds. Emojis are a fun and playful way of communicating emotions and ideas, used by millions across the globe, giving us all some common ground. In my own
 experience of visiting the Triennial, I couldn’t help but notice how immersed children became with the photos. While a small child may not recognise and appreciate a work from Mondrian, they can easily identify and get excited about the poo emoji.
While it is important to be aware and appreciate what came before us, it’s time to embrace the future of art and design.
